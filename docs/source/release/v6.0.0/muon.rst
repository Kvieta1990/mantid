Muon Analysis 2 and Frequency Domain Analysis
---------------------------------------------

New Features
############

Improvements
############

Bug fixes
#########

ALC
---

New Features
############

Elemental Analysis
------------------

New Features
############

Bug fixes
#########

Algorithms
----------
- :ref:`algm-LoadElementalAnalysisData` algorithm was introduced for loading runs for the new Elemental Analysis GUI, enabling it to be registered by WorkspaceHistory.
- The functions RemoveExpDecay and EstimateMuonAsymmetryFromCounts were modified to use point data instead of bin edges for removing the exponential.
- LoadPSIMuonBin and LoadMuonNexusV2 can now return a table of time zeros
- MuonPreProcess has a new input 'TimeZeroTable' which requires a TableWorkspace of time zero values
