Improvements
############

 - In :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>`, the beam radius can be different for each distance.
   A new parameter, TransmissionBeamRadius, has been added to set the beam radius for transmission experiments.
   The default value of all beam radii is now 0.1m.


:ref:`Release 6.0.0 <v6.0.0>`
